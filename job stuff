I am proficient in circuit analysis of any type of resistor-capacitor-inductor network with an emphasis on transmission line and three-phase power systems. I have also studied quiescent current and voltage analysis as well as practical systems such as relay-based circuits.

M. J. Electric Field Engineer 1120
Automation and Process Control Intern  (Job Number:  017446W-01)

I have experience with AutoCAD as well as other drafting software such as SPICE and EAGLE. I have extensive knowledge of all Office software including Microsoft Excel and Word. I feel that my HMI, PLC, and SCADA programming skills would be useful for a position like this, especially given their indirect benefit of helping me understand how power devices work.
