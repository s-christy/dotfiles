in latin, u is written as v. For instance, lingua can be written as lingva. For the sake of consistancy, we will only use v in this dictionary
suffixes will start with a - character
latin is a highly inflected language, so it uses far fewer words for the same effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection)
