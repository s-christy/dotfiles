		This page, contains many of my beliefs with respect to technology.

		<h2>Languages of Choice</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>Coding-C/C++
		<li>Scripting-Bash/Python
		<li>Web-HTML/CSS/PHP
		<li>Scientific-R
		<li>Document Compilation-LaTeX
		</ul>

		<h2>Why Use C?</h2>
		<p>

		I like to compare programming languages and natural languages. Imagine there were two versions of English, one core version, and one version with twice the syntactic complexity. The second version was made to provide numerous quality of life improvements. For instance, now that every word has many synonyms, people can take advantage of the connotation of one synonym over the other.
		C is simple, stable, legible

		<h2>IDE or Nah?</h2>
		<p>
		I prefer to use makefiles and a terminal based text editors for several reasons: The first is portability. When you add a library into an IDE like Visual Studio, it is essentially creating its own list of instructions for building the project from scratch when you hit the compile button. This is awful if you ever intend on switching your IDE, or if you have a partner who uses another IDE or, god forbid another operating system. Makefiles are a cross platform and cross IDE solution. Even if you use Visual Studio, you should still use makefiles. Another reason to ditch IDEs is for greater configurability. If you prefer modal bindings instead of modeless, you cannot use Visual Studio because it cannot be configured for that type of editing.

		<h2>Why Would Anyone Use Linux Over Windows?</h2>
		<p>
		After all, I can run all of the software I need under Windows just fine! Well I'm different. Most of the software I use on a daily basis, like grep, Git, i3, and vim are either difficult or impossible to run under Windows. If all I needed out of my computer was a browser and video games I would use Windows, but I need <em>MORE</em>. I need to be able to find a file that I can't quite remember the name of without waiting 20 seconds for the Windows "quick access" search to load. I need to have grep -r, and sed, and vim, and multiple workspaces, and apt and not having to restart after <em>every update</em> and uptime -p. Even TAB COMPLETE doesn't work on Windows TODO check that. Also make this a list instead of a rant. https://olimex.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/16-things-i-like-in-linux-which-doesnt-exist-in-windows/

		<h2>Why Use LaTeX Over a Graphical Word Processor?</h2>

		Yes.

		<h2>Alcohol?</h2>

		Nah.
