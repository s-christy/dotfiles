remember r1-l1-l1-l1... for saw cleaver/spear
buy fire paper with insight
learn where beast blood pellets are-lower insight for more effectiveness
learn where twin blood stone shards are-there are a lot in Hemwick Charnel lane
figure out a strategy for runes
it might be faster to kill the spiders in the rom fight by attacking their heads until they stagger
LEVEL UP VITALITY MOST

strategies
paarl-hit legs
gascoigne-parry until beast mode, then molotovs
vicar amelia-attack legs and use fire paper/beast blood pellets
witches-attack each enemy to half health and then move on
rom-attack small spider heads until they stagger, bait attacks then run in and attack twice then run away
one reborn-use BOLT paper and BB pellet and tank all damage until the room fills with acid. Also kill bell ringers?
micolash-If I stay close he may not use his ranged attack
