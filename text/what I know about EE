555 timer is for PWM
LM317 is for building your own power supply with voltage and current controls
H-bridges
op amps can be used as buffers if - and out are shorted
N channel mosfets have 1/3 the resistance of P channel
transformers only work with AC voltages

questions:
	what's the difference between a triac and SCR?


H-bridge
	used in power converters (DC-AC and others)
	used in motor controllers
power inverter
	changes DC to AC
	some inverters have mechanical parts, most are static
	square waves produce a humming noise usually
push-pull converter
	DC to DC
	TODO I don't understand
