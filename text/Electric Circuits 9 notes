There are 3 basic assumptions of circuit theory
	1: Voltage and current are transmitted instantaneously
	2: The net charge of every component is always 0
	3: There is no magnetic coupling between components

Memorize tables 1.1 and 1.2, they are SI units and derived units

All electric charge is a multiple of 1.61*10-19 Coulombs

Voltage is energy created by the separation of positive and negative charges per charge carrier
current is the flow of charge carriers

V=IR
P=VI
P=IIR

5 basic circuit elements
	voltage sources
	current sources
	inductors
	resistors
	capacitors

Current/voltage sources can be either dependent or independent

Was the fact that George Simon Ohm has the same last name as a Greek letter just a happy coincidence?

Siemens and mhos are the same thing

short circuit vs open circuit
