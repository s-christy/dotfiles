would removing the smallest element from a max heap be O(1)

know the difference between depth first and breadth first

most heap operations are log(n)

pre- vs in- vs post-order traversal

1
a find operations are n
b traversal operations are n
c removing root operations are logn
d sort operations are nlogn
e breadth/depth searches are n or V+E
f dijkstra's algorithm is nlogn or ElogV

2
a illustrate the heap by filling in the bubbles top to bottom and left to right
b percolate down by replacing the bad data with the larger of the two children in a max heap
c when adding data, add it to the very last open node

3
a add all the numbers to the binary search tree
b pre-order traversal is DLR
c in-order traversal is LDR (also sorts it from smallest to largest)
d post-order traversal is LRD
e delete(n) replaces n with the next larger number NOT the larger child necessarily

4
~

5
a BFS looks at all the neighbors of A, then moves to B and looks at all its neighbors
b DFS follows the neighbors immediately in alphabetical order
c label all rows in "vertex" from A-n


min heap vs max heap-in a min heap the smallest number is at the top
know how to do a remove operation
