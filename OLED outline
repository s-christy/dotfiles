		Edge phone
		curved tv
			TODO-why do they have to be OLED?
		watches
			need the ruggedness, lightweight quality, and energy efficiency of OLEDs
		foldable
			substrate is very flexible metallic foil or plastic
			lightweight and durable
			fabrics/smart clothing
				adaptive camo
				outdoor survival clothing with an integrated computer chip, cell phone, GPS receiver and OLED display sewn into it.
		transparent
